Deep Learning Techniques for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using Python-
Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. Early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death. It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible.
In this proposed system we are able to identify the rate of breast cancer. By prediction of Breast cancer in healthcare we are able to take suitable measures accordingly to control the cancer tissue. Due to the large size of each image in the training dataset, we propose a technique which consists of two consecutive convolutional neural networks. By using deep neural networks we are predicting the cancer is benign or malignant.Users have feasibility to upload scanned images on a web page to know about the status.
